title: Teaching Well-Being
order: 1.8

<p class="lead" id="top">Central to Georgetown’s educational mission is the Jesuit ideal of
  “<a href="https://missionandministry.georgetown.edu/thespiritofgeorgetown/values#wholeperson">Educating the whole person</a>.” This ideal calls for
  both students and faculty to bring their “whole selves” into the
  classroom—intellectual curiosity and critical thinking, certainly, but also the full range of human experience and development.</p>

<h3>Campus Safety Net</h3>
<p>The idea of “care for the whole person” can be realized in many different ways. One way that faculty can care for students
  is to equip themselves with resources to help students who may be struggling. It is helpful to familiarize yourself with
  campus organizations such as
  <a href="https://studenthealth.georgetown.edu/mental-health">Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS)</a>,
  <a href="https://studenthealth.georgetown.edu/health-promotion">Health Education Services (HES)</a>, the
  <a href="https://cmea.georgetown.edu/">Center for Multicultural Equity &amp; Access (CMEA)</a>, and the
  <a href="https://lgbtq.georgetown.edu/">LGBTQ Resource Center</a>, as well as, more broadly,
  <a href="https://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/counselors">confidential counseling resources</a> for all sorts of student concerns and needs, including crisis intervention and counseling
  services around sexual assault.</p>

<h3>The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning</h3>
<p>Georgetown’s Engelhard Project embodies the mission of “educating the whole person” by providing a framework for faculty
  who wish to integrate issues of health and wellness into their courses. Using a curriculum infusion model, Engelhard faculty
  fellows partner with campus health professionals to link health topics with academic course content, not only empowering
  students to learn about the health topics but also making the academic course content relevant to their lives outside the
  classroom. Visit the
  <a href="http://engelhard.georgetown.edu/">Engelhard Project website</a> to read course profiles and to learn more about the project.</p>

<p>A few questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What would it mean to adopt
    <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='design_learning_goals') }}">learning goals</a> that go beyond intellectual objectives (e.g., mastering concepts and academic skills) to invite personal
    development? For example, students in your course might be able to develop an excitement for the field; a feeling of
    well-earned self-confidence; a greater understanding of their own life experience, values, and long-term objectives;
    a sense of purpose; and/or a physically healthier approach to work, studying, nutrition, and/or exercise.</li>
  <li>Could you get to know your students better as individuals? Georgetown is also driven by the
    <a href="https://missionandministry.georgetown.edu/thespiritofgeorgetown/values#cura">Jesuit value of cura personalis</a>, “individualized attention to the needs of the other, distinct respect for his or
    her unique circumstances and concerns, and an appropriate appreciation for his or her particular gifts and insights.”
    Do you demonstrate an interest in students’ lives? Where possible, get to know your students’ names and also their varied
    experiences, strengths, and struggles, many of which could prove relevant to a powerful learning experience. You can
    draw out these individualities in office hours—encouraging students to attend office hours is a great idea for many reasons—but
    you can also use class discussions, exercises, and/or written assignments that invite self-reflection.</li>
  <li>Do you cultivate an awareness of how cultural factors (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, disability status, etc.) can impact
    students’ engagement with your course and its particular material? Do you keep track of events (global, national, local,
    and campus) that could impact that learning and perhaps interact with cultural factors as well? For example, if violence
    directed at a particular racial group reaches the news, it might well be on many students’ minds, and some more than
    others. In other words, are you aware of the ways in which students’ out-of-class experiences are affecting them, or
    the fact that any two students, based on cultural factors, might be having very different experiences in life and in
    your course?</li>
  <li>Could your course include activities designed to promote well-being (e.g., mindfulness exercises, meditation, pauses for
    a few deep breaths and/or stretching, student self-monitoring of health behaviors and/or emotional responses to course
    material, starting class with a pause to set aside nagging distractions)? These activities are likely to prove beneficial
    not only to students’ well-being but also to their ability to engage and master course material.</li>
  <li>What aspects of student development are you assessing in your course? In other words, how will you know that students have
    attained the course’s well-being goals? In addition to testing the knowledge and disciplinary abilities students have
    acquired, you could also gather information on ethical, personal, and/or emotional growth. The same self-reflective activities
    you use to get to know them—conversations, writing, and individual and collaborative group exercises—can also provide
    evidence on their holistic maturation.</li>

<h3>Opening Up to Students</h3>

<p>Inviting students to bring their complete selves into the classroom requires faculty to do the same in some way. In the video
  about the Engelhard Project below, several faculty members share their compelling stories about how opening up to students
  can create a foundation of trust to build a true community in the classroom, one that makes the learning experience more
  powerful for all.</p>
