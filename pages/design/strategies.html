title: Teaching Strategies
order: 1.5

<p class="lead">After <a href="{{ ROOT_URL }}/design/learning_goals/">establishing goals</a> and designing student learning <a href="{{ ROOT_URL }}/design/assessment/">assessments</a> for your course, decide on your course delivery methods. Build the rest of the syllabus to clarify what you expect of your students and how you will be accountable to them.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your learning goals and built your assessment assignments to work towards those goals, finish planning the class by deciding on the teaching strategies that you will undertake, bearing in mind that flexibility may be important in order to respond to the needs of your particular set of students.</p>

* If you are teaching after an extended hiatus from instruction and have written a teaching philosophy statement in the past, take a moment to review it and reacquaint yourself with your principles and priorities.
* If you have been teaching recently, reflect on what went well and what didn't in your recent courses. 
* Think about how a normal class period in this course will be structured. Will you engage students in discussion, seminar-style? Will you lecture and have students break out regularly into small groups? The answers you give these questions will depend on a number of variables, including the <a href="{{ ROOT_URL }}/teach/classroom.html">setup of your room</a>, your enrollment, and whether the class is upper-level or introductory. Does your course topic lend itself to conflict, debate, and perhaps even <a href="{{ ROOT_URL }}/teach/discussion.html">difficult discussions</a>? If so, will you make room for and facilitate those discussions?</p>

<h2>Active engagement</h2>

<p>Because student engagement with coursework translates into learning that lasts, taking stock of the principles and practices that lead to student investment in course material can make a dramatic difference in what students take away from a course.</p>

<p>Students learn best when they actively engage the course material. Such engagement requires going beyond the memorization of content to working with the content in ways appropriate for the disciplinary context and the student level of development. Making explicit connections between course material and students' lives outside the classroom enables them to engage more deeply with the disciplinary content and become invested in it. Student investment is a committed type of engagement. It is something that often grows when a student has become convinced of the ongoing value of a course of action. Instructors can help students invest in their learning by contextualizing the assignment or topic within the meaningful "big picture." When students recognize the value of a course and can see concrete examples of how it connects to their lives, they are better equipped to appreciate the abstract concepts and invest in learning the material.</p>

<p>Acting upon those connections can also enhance student engagement with learning. One possibility for actively engaging learning is assigning students projects that engage them in the local community, experiencing local resources and conversations. Participating in a local community service project is one possible assignment that engages students with the community. Drawing links between academic material and their local milieu can make the classroom and the community more meaningful to students, and incorporating relevant volunteer projects can enrich class discussions and student projects in a range of ways. Community-based learning is a key part of the Georgetown experience as part of the university's mission to educate "men and women for others."</p>

<p>Another way to increase student engagement is to scaffold experiences for students to reflect on their learning and make integrative connections across courses and disciplines. Building an ePortfolio or keeping an online journal, especially one of which the students feel they have visual ownership, can help inspire students to invest time and pride into their work.</p>

<p>Many of these strategies for improving student engagement can be viewed as social pedagogies. Social pedagogies refer to, as articulated by Randy Bass, those "design approaches for teaching and learning that engage students with what we might call an 'authentic audience' (other than the teacher), where the representation of knowledge for an audience is absolutely central to the construction of knowledge in a course." In the enaction of a social pedagogy, the audience for which a student writes is no longer just the instructor or an imagined audience; instead, what students do is create work that is visible and meaningful to others, often their classmates but sometimes the world. Students often feel more energized to do good work when they are held accountable for their work (receiving praise as well as constructive criticism) by others, not just their professor.</p>

<h2>Classroom technologies</h2>

<p>There is a wide range of classroom technologies—from chalkboard or whiteboard to recent multimedia and collaborative environments—all of which may have a legitimate place in today's classroom.</p>

<p>For generations, classroom technologies changed little, mainly serving to assist the instructor in delivering his or her lecture efficiently. Today the range and purposes of technologies are highly diverse, and creative appropriations continue to grow. Technologies can be used for any number of learning-related activities, from supporting the delivery of a lecture to engaging students in discussion between lessons. Whatever the technologies chosen, they should always serve the purpose of advancing the course goals. To that end, it is useful to apply the principles of backward design to the integration of technology when designing a course. Students learn in different ways and their learning can be better supported by the use of multiple teaching methods and modes of instruction (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write). When judiciously integrated into the course, multimedia technologies can be crucial for extending the range of ways in which students acquire new knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>The type of technology you use will depend on the type of course you are offering. In lecture-based courses, technology that assists delivery—like a chalkboard or an instructor computer connected to a projector—might be sufficient. For a more interactive approach to technology, personal response systems like clickers can be used to enhance student attention and learning. More advanced technologies can be incorporated into the very design of a course. By moving parts of a course to an online environment, you can free up precious class time for collaborative face-to-face activities and discussion. Is the class based on a pre-class reading? You can distribute the reading online, and you can also ask students to answer questions or post comments on the reading using a tool such as Blackboard or a course blog. Having students do this thinking before class can help further focus the class-time conversation.</p>

<p>Current social software, such as blogs and wikis, allow for considerably more advanced forms of student collaboration and student authorship in the course. Indeed, they may well foster a community of learners within the class. Take advantage of students' familiarity with technology by allowing them to co-design activities or models of assignments based on their expertise and communicative habits. When students are encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning, they are more likely to develop higher-order thinking skills.</p>

<p>Technology can also bring a new dimension of nuance to drafts and early/intermediate work. When students turn in a polished assignment, the research and editing process that brought them to that stage is invisible; the final product offers little evidence of the iterative process that brought it to life. Giving each student a research project blog or asking students to draft in Google Docs, however, can make the research and presentation process much richer. A research project blog would give students a venue to exhibit their emerging work by posting drafts and status updates, while Google Docs allows sharing, commenting, and synchronous editing, all while maintaining a detailed history of edits. Throughout the semester, you might comment on students' projects. You might also encourage students to offer ideas for each other's developing research projects or to engage in formal peer review. The practice of peer review helps students develop critical reading skills, learn how to assemble constructive criticism, and learn how to receive feedback on their ideas. Students can learn how arguments are constructed, and work on making their own arguments stronger.</p>

<p>You may also want to think about how technology can help make the impact of your lecture both greater and more lasting. By using lecture capture software to record your lectures and a course site to distribute them afterward, you can make course material accessible to students beyond the class period. Providing lectures online lets students access this information multiple times after a class, increasing their chances for retention. In addition, this archive of work can be especially helpful in cases of weather-related closures or other events that prevent classes from meeting physically.</p>
