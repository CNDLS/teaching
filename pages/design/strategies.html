title: Teaching Strategies
order: 1.7

<p class="lead">Once you have chosen your <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='design_learning_goals') }}">learning goals</a> and built your <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='design/assessment') }}">assessment assignments</a> to work towards those goals, finish planning the class by choosing the teaching strategies that you’ll use, bearing in mind that flexibility may be important in order to respond to the needs of your particular set of students.</p>

* If you’re teaching after an extended hiatus from instruction and have written a teaching philosophy statement in the past, take a moment to review it and reacquaint yourself with your principles and priorities.
* If you’ve been teaching recently, reflect on what went well in your recent courses and what didn't, and build the class based on those reflections.
* Think about how a normal class period in this course will be structured. Will you engage students in <a href="https://commons.georgetown.edu/teaching/teach/planning-leading/">discussion</a>, seminar-style? Will you lecture and have students break out regularly into small groups? In what ways will <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='teach') }}">active learning</a> be part of the course? The answers you give to these questions will depend on a number of things, including the <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='teach/classroom') }}">setup of your room</a>, your enrollment, and whether the class is upper-level or introductory. Does your course topic lend itself to conflict, debate, and perhaps even <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='teach/planning-leading') }}">difficult discussions</a>? If so, will you make room for and facilitate those discussions?
