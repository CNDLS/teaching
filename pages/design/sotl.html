title: Scholarship of Teaching & Learning
order: 1.7

In many CNDLS, <a href="https://cndls.georgetown.edu/doyle/">Doyle</a>, <a href="http://engelhard.georgetown.edu/">Engelhard</a>, and <a href="https://itel.georgetown.edu/">ITEL</a> projects, faculty develop new strategies and tools for teaching. Such efforts generate two important questions:

* How does it work, for faculty and for students? 
* What does this project reveal that might be helpful to others?
 
Within higher education, across disciplines, scholars have developed a range of methods and theories that can help faculty trace, analyze, and share the results of classroom and program experiments. Under the heading of “scholarship of teaching and learning,” you’ll find ideas about the nature and process of learning as well as models for how to study students’ learning and opportunities for sharing the results of your work with colleagues within and beyond the University.  On this page, we’ve collected a few suggestions for getting started.
 
The **Center for Teaching at Vanderbilt University** has an online tutorial that includes sections on <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/sotl/doing-sotl/getting-started/">framing questions</a>, <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/sotl/doing-sotl/conducting-a-lit-review/">conducting a literature review</a>, and <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/sotl/doing-sotl/gathering-evidence/">identifying</a> and <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/sotl/doing-sotl/analyzing-data/">analyzing evidence of student learning</a>.
 
Elon University’s **Center for Engaged Learning** has created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1_tW7hM2sCqxJfiolKcOYNVo8Ng4ob6">set of short videos</a> in which faculty talk about their approaches to scholarship of teaching and learning.
 
The **Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning at Central Florida University** provides a brief overview of <a href="http://www.fctl.ucf.edu/ResearchAndScholarship/SoTL/creatingSoTLProjects/">Creating SoTL Projects</a>, including sections on designing, conducting, and publishing research on your students’ learning.
