title: Creating Your Syllabus
order: "1.10"

<p class="lead">The syllabus presents students with a first impression of your course. It offers many opportunities to share what the learning experience in your course will be like&mdash;both explicitly, with the information that you choose to include, and implicitly, with the tone that you set.</p>

Think about how the syllabus functions in your teaching. Which of these roles does your syllabus play in your courses? Is there a new function for your syllabus that you might want to try with your next course?

The syllabus can be:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <ul>
      <li>a clearinghouse of logistical information</li>
      <li>a teaser for the content of the course</li>
      <li>a manifestation of your course design</li>
      <li>an invitation to students to join you on an intellectual journey</li>
      <li>a contract with students outlining expectations and consequences</li>
      <li>a reflection of your teaching philosophy</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <ul>
      <li>an explanation of how to be a successful student in the course</li>
      <li>a representation of university- or program-level policies and approaches</li>
      <li>a roadmap of the course</li>
      <li>a way to scaffold students throughout the course</li>
      <li>a guidepost to orient your course within the larger field of study</li>
      <li>a resource for students who want to explore the topic further</li>
    </ul>

## Ask yourself

Does your syllabus make sense to someone who is unfamiliar with your course material? Ask a friend or colleague, ideally someone outside your department, to review your syllabus and identify any points of confusion.
