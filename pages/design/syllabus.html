title: The Syllabus
order: 1.6

<p class="lead">The syllabus presents students with a first impression of your course. It offers many opportunities to share what the learning experience in your course will be like&mdash;both explicitly, with the information that you choose to include, and implicitly, with the tone that you set.</p>

Think about how the syllabus functions in your teaching. Which of these roles does your syllabus play in your courses? Is there a new function for your syllabus that you might want to try with your next course? 

The syllabus can be:

* a clearinghouse of logistical information 
* a teaser for the content of the course
* a manifestation of your course design
* an invitation to students to join you on an intellectual journey
* a contract with students outlining expectations and consequences
* a reflection of your teaching philosophy
* an explanation of how to be a successful student in the course
* a representation of university- or program-level policies and approaches
* a roadmap of the course
* a way to scaffold students throughout the course
* a guidepost to orient your course within the larger field of study
* a resource for students who want to explore the topic further
* Other...



What should a carefully crafted syllabus contain? This checklist offers a reminder of key elements as well as some ideas for optional items you may want to include.

## Ask yourself

Does your syllabus make sense to someone who is unfamiliar with your course material? Ask a friend or colleague, ideally someone outside your department, to review your syllabus and identify any points of confusion.
