title: The Syllabus
order: 1.6

<p class="lead">A syllabus is like the course's roadmap. It shows students where they will go, what resources they will have to help them get there, and how you will assess their progress on this journey.</p>

<h2>1. What is the syllabus?</h2>

<p>The syllabus is much more than a schedule of assignments and a collection of logistical information about a course:  it is the concrete manifestation of the design of a course.

Expressing the elements of your course design in the form of a syllabus can help you clarify for yourself what you want your students to learn and how you will help them learn it. As you develop expertise in a discipline, much of your disciplinary knowledge (including content, skills, and techniques) becomes tacit. In order to develop a learning plan for students, you must first make more visible to yourself the disciplinary knowledge and skills that have become second nature to you.

A thoughtful course design process yields a syllabus that says to your students, "This is who I am as an instructor. This is what I intend for you to learn this semester. And this is how I'm going not only to help you learn these things but also to assess whether you have learned them."</p>

<h2>2. What elements does the syllabus contain?</h2>

<p>Students benefit greatly from a carefully crafted syllabus. A good syllabus contains learning goals, resources to help students achieve the course goals, and an indication of what students will be able to do after completing this course. It helps students understand the conceptual structure of the course. 

Here are some elements of a complete course syllabus:</p>

        <h3>May also contain</h3>
        <ul>

<p>Beyond the learning goals, assignments, teaching strategies and other course elements, a syllabus should also address expectations of student behavior. Address the issue of academic integrity and be proactive in pointing out resources on campus and online that can help students do research that meets the high standards you expect of them. At Georgetown, the library is a great resource for questions on research methods and citations, and the Honor Council's website answers some commonly asked questions about the ethics of referring to others' research, reusing one's own research, and more. Be sure that students know not only that Georgetown strictly enforces academic honesty, but that good research methodology will serve them throughout their career. Be sure to also explain your expectations for attendance, participation, and assignment delivery, in addition to any other expectations you lay out for your students in the syllabus.</p>

<p>A good syllabus also indicates your commitment and accountability to the students. This involves both your your availability to students outside of class and the feedback and assessment you will be doing. The more information you can provide about feedback and assessment, the better. Many faculty members include detailed guidelines, grading rubrics, and assignment return dates in their syllabi.</p>

<h2>3. What should I do with the syllabus?</h2>

<p>Now that you have developed a complete syllabus that tells students everything they need to know about the course, how can you make sure they use it to its full advantage? Since otherwise, students might just give the syllabus a cursory read to find out the nature of the class assignments, the grading scheme, the reading list, etc., we recommend that you spend time on the first day of class going over the syllabus in detail and requiring students to demonstrate that they understand the nature and purpose of the different elements of the course. Some faculty members ask students to map out the concepts studied in the course, to familiarize themselves with the syllabus and then quiz their classmates about the various elements of the course, to rank or group the course learning goals, etc.</p>

<p>Although the syllabus is generally considered a contract between you and the students, situations may arise where it is necessary to modify the syllabus during the semester. When dealing with these situations, bear in mind that students often plan their schedules many weeks in advance. Significant modifications to course requirements or due dates may cause students great distress, so we recommend that you do not make modifications lightly and that you gather student feedback anonymously (to avoid peer pressure) before making an important decision. If a syllabus change affects the way students' grades are calculated, you may give students the option to be graded according to the original course requirements and criteria.</p>
