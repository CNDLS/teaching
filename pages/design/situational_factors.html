title: Situational Factors
order: 1.2

<p class="lead">Before beginning to design your course, we recommend that you consider a number of situational factors, including the following:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Characteristics of the learners</li>
	<li>Characteristics of the teacher</li>
	<li>Nature of the subject/discipline</li>
	<li>Nature/particular context of the course</li>
	<li>Accessibility (Universal Instructional Design)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Gathering information about and reflecting on these types of factors can inform important course design decisions, though some factors may be more relevant than others. Even if you teach from a syllabus that your department provides, it is still helpful to consider some of these factors when determining your teaching strategies and planning community-building initiatives.</p>

<p>For example, if your course is an advanced course for students aiming to enter a certain profession, you could design opportunities for students to connect with professionals working in the field. Or, if there is new knowledge emerging in your field that is changing the way scholars understand the subject matter, you can design class activities and assignments around these turning points.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of the learners</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>age, gender, cultural/linguistic background, family and work situations</li>
	<li>other involvement, such as student clubs leadership
	<li>program of study, year in program, background knowledge and experience</li>
	<li>educational goals, professional goals, life goals, attitudes and efficacy of the 		course/subject/program, and </li>
	<li>expectations about classroom norms and preferred learning styles</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Characteristics of the teacher</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>philosophy of teaching</li>
	<li>preferred teaching strategies</li>
	<li>attitude toward/beliefs about the students</li>
	<li>level of knowledge of the subject</li>
	<li>level of experience teaching this course or similar courses</li>
	<li>sphere of involvement in the department/program/institution</li>
	<li>professional contacts in the field</li>
	<li>level of departmental/institutional support for teaching</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Nature and related skills of the subject or discipline</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>contested or newly developing knowledge/practices in the subject/discipline</li>
	<li>types of teaching strategies frequently used to teach this subject</li>
	<li>types of tasks a professional in this discipline frequently carries out</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Particular context of the course</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>level of the course</li>
	<li>required/elective nature of the course</li>
	<li>place of the course in a sequence</li>
	<li>attitude of department/program toward the course</li>
	<li>number of students in the course</li>
	<li>frequency and location of course meetings, mode(s) of instruction</li>
	<li><u>threshold concepts</u> the course will include</li>
</ul>
<p class="attribution">In "<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/ftep/documents/ETLreport4-1.pdf">Threshold Concepts and Troublesome Knowledge</a>", Meyer and Land define the term: "A threshold concept can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress."</p>
</p>

<h2>Accessibility (Universal Instructional Design)</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>making teaching materials accessible in various formats (example, example) as a general practice, not just when a student with a disability enrolls in your course</li>
	<li>when possible, selecting content, teaching strategies, and materials that reflect a wide range of traditions, perspectives and lived experiences</li>
</ul>
<p class="attribution">This is where we'll add the reference for "Universal Instructional Design"</p>
