<p class="lead">There are crucial differences between experts and novices that have implications for the best way for experts in a discipline to help novices in that discipline learn the material.</p>

<h2>Differences between Experts and Novices</h2>

<p>When an individual develops expertise on the move from novice to expert, much of the knowledge and many of the skills become tacit. The knowledge and skills become second nature; in a sense, the expert no longer knows that he knows them. Uncovering this hidden knowledge becomes vital in the task of teachingâ€”in helping novices become more expert.</p>

<p>Some of what the expert "knows but does not know that s/he knows" are what <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BK0ujc6zK58C&oi=fnd&pg=PT33&dq=meyer+land+threshold+concepts&ots=iMsAWr8a5U&sig=7KOogvqwkwi4LNp5KT9jvpQrClY#v=onepage&q=meyer%20land%20threshold%20concepts&f=false">Meyer and Land</a> have called <em>threshold concepts</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A threshold concept can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress.</p>
<p class="attribution">Jan H. F. Meyer &amp; Ray Land</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is sometimes difficult for experts in a discipline to look back across that threshold and see the discipline as they saw as a novice in the field. Another characteristic of mastery in a subject is the acquisition of adaptive expertise, or the ability to apply tools, strategies, and content knowledge in new ways to navigate uncertainty or ambiguity.</p>

<p>Experts in a discipline have developed an elaborate structure of disciplinary content. Adding new content knowledge to that structure is often easier than it would be otherwise because there is a place for it in the structure. In contrast, novices lack such a structure (or are just beginning to develop one). For novices, learning new content requires not only learning the content but also developing the structure in which that knowledge is contextualized. Novices must often spend considerably more cognitive energy when learning than the expert might expect them to spend. This move from novice to expert has been characterized as a move from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence and from conscious competence to unconscious competence. With this characterization in mind, one could say that the expert who wishes to teach well needs to become explicitly aware of much of their competence that has become more or less invisible.</p>

<h2>Suggested Strategies</h2>

<p>In order to actively uncover disciplinary thinking processes and skills for students, take the time to build into the course opportunities to model expert skills and intellectual moves for students. In order to decide what to model, you might do a self-reflective, process-identifying exercise. How do you do what you do successfully? How can students replicate your expert process? What steps do they need to take? For example, you might read a passage from a book and offer meta-reflections on your thinking as you read. Discuss where you see intertextual references; where you see a response to an historic conversation; where you pause to reflect or reread. Instructors can also bring in outside experts, either in-person or virtually, to diversify students' exposure to expert practice in the field. Ideas for incorporating outside experts might include inviting a professional to give a guest lecture, soliciting comments from professional figures around the nation on a course blog, or having students conduct email exchanges with experts in the field.</p>

<p>Instructors can also produce documentation of students modeling disciplinary behaviors. As discussed above, developing expertise requires students not only to master particular content, but also to understand the process behind that content. In other words, students not only have to learn material; they also have to learn how to learn according to disciplinary standards. By providing students with a model of expert thinking by engaging in "think-aloud" tasks in front of students, instructors can make explicit the important implicit processes that the instructor is asking students to master. And instructors can also ask students to record their own "think-aloud" sessions as they solve homework problems. These recordings allow the instructor to see students' problem-solving processes and make recommendations on ways to improve those processes.</p>

<p>Finally, offering students the opportunity to work side-by-side with a mentor on a research project can have a profound impact on the students' growth and learning. The <a href="http://www.aacu.org/leap/hip.cfm">AAC&amp;U's report on high-impact practices</a> registers undergraduate research as an important opportunity for students to gain "the sense of excitement that comes from working to answer important questions," and, if designed intentionally, it can also help students develop the expertise that comes from grappling with real-life uncertainties and changing conditions.</p>
