title: Designing Assessments
order: 1.4

<p class="lead">Once you have clearly articulated learning goals for your course, you will need to figure out how to measure students’ progress toward those goals.</p>

In addition to giving students explicit feedback, assessment activities also offer faculty the opportunity to evaluate the success of their course design and adapt as needed. 

There are many ways to gather and analyze evidence of student learning. Georgetown’s <A href="http://assessment.georgetown.edu/">Assessment Portal</a> offers a framework of guiding questions to help you develop an iterative plan for course-level assessment, from initial development of learning goals to mid-semester evaluation methods to post-course analysis, reflection, and redesign.

Assessments don't necessarily have to involve grades. However, if it's relevant, you can explore a fuller discussion of the grading process on our <a href="https://commons.georgetown.edu/teaching/teach/grading/" target="blank">Grading page</a>.
