title: Evaluating Student Learning
order: 2.7

<p class=lead>The learning goals you have defined for your students should shape both the overall design of your course and the specific student assignments. The learning goals should also inform your grading criteria and practices. Many faculty find it helpful to develop an explicit grading rubric.</p>
 
<p>A rubric is a matrix-shaped assessment tool that determines that different criteria on which a task or assignment will be evaluated and describes different levels of performance in each domain (e.g. - sophisticated, competent, partly competent and not competent). Such a rubric lays out the criteria an instructor will use when evaluating student work. Developing a rubric before grading an assignment can take time, but using it as you grade will help you maintain consistency and fairness in your grading.</p>

<p>Creating a detailed rubric is an investment of time and energy up front, but it will save time when grading and should yield a more accurate assessment, since it ensures that a student’s performance in one domain (e.g. - writing) does not influence their grade in another domain (e.g. - complexity of arguments). When applying a rubric to a student’s work, you would assess their level of performance in each of the criteria you have identified, using the descriptors to help you select the level that best matches; then you would determine an overall grade based on where you rated their performance in the various domains.</p>

<p>Seeing the rubric according to which you evaluated their work helps students understand their grades and, more importantly, shows them what areas they could improve in and (thanks to the descriptors) what a more successful performance in those areas would look like. Having the grading rubric in advance also helps students do better work, since they can clearly see the expectations and assess their own performance using the same tool you will use. Some faculty members even ask students to apply the rubric to their work and submit this self-assessment along with their assignment, which guarantees that students will have reflected on the quality of their work and the ways in which it meets expectations. If you use this method, make sure that you discuss any discrepancies between the self-assessment and your assessment in the feedback you return to students along with their grade.</p>

<p>Other time-saving grading tools that can help you evaluate student performance accurately are checklists and scales.</p>

<h2>Checklists</h2>

<p>A checklist is the most simple of the tools mentioned on this page:  it is a list of all the elements that you are looking for in student work. You would apply it to the student’s work, checking off each element that is present. You would then determine a global grade based on which elements were present and which were absent. A checklist might be useful when you are most concerned with whether the student has completed all essential parts of the work. Some faculty members use these on lab reports, on blog posts or on reading responses.</p> 

<h2>Scales</h2>

<p>A scale is slightly more complex than a checklist:  it involves assigning a point value to each element that you are evaluating in student work and then rating the student’s level of achievement for each element. You would then add up the number of points the student has earned in each category to yield the point total for the assignment. Because a scale evaluates each element or domain of a student’s work independently, it helps you to assess a student’s work fairly, and it is a good alternative to a rubric.</p>
