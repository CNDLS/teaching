title: Evaluating Student Learning
order: 2.9

<p class=lead>Assessment activities should be designed to measure students’ progress toward the learning goals you have articulated.</p>

Creating explicit rubrics will help you analyze student work, and can also help students to understand how to be successful in the course. Georgetown’s Assessment Portal presents a <a href="http://assessment.georgetown.edu/courselevel/interpret-evidence-of-learning/rubrics/">guide for developing rubrics</a>, including links to examples. 

In addition to formal assessments such as quizzes, problem sets, papers, and exams, you may also consider integrating informal Classroom Assessment Techniques into your teaching. Visit <a href="http://assessment.georgetown.edu/courselevel/gather-evidence-of-student-learning/classroom-assessment-techniques/">this page</a> for some ideas.
