title: Classroom Space
order: 2.2

<p class="lead">You may not have much or any say in where you will teach, but it can still be a useful exercise to envision the ideal classroom space for your course.</p>

<p>When selecting your teaching strategies, it is important to consider the physical layout, characteristics, and overall design of the classroom space. At many institutions, including Georgetown, instructors may request particular classroom characteristics, features, and locations from the Registrar. Sometimes, you can request that your class be held in different rooms on different days of the week, which allows you to schedule activities around each room's specific characteristics.</p>

<p>Some classrooms lend themselves more readily to reconfiguration than others.</p>

* If you wish to use a variety of teaching strategies, such as lecture, small group work, and round table discussion, mobile or modular desks and chairs and the space for instructor and students to move around can be crucial to the class's success.
* If you require in-class collaborative work, make sure that the students have easy ways to reposition themselves as needed.
* However, you should not give up on small-group activities even in fixed-seat or tightly-packed arena classrooms: students can still work with those immediately beside and behind them. Try to be resourceful about space; for example, if your course includes film viewings but a theater-style room is not available, consider whether you can still show the films in a regular classroom with a screen and a DVD player.</p>

<p>You may need to make some adjustments to your teaching style in response to the classroom space.</p>

* If you are used to teaching a small, seminar-style class but find yourself assigned to a high-enrollment class in a large room, you will need to get used to projecting your voice further and to making eye contact with students in far-flung corners of the room.
* If it happens that your class is scheduled in a larger space than it requires, you may ask students to sit in one area of the room, such as the first few rows or one side of the aisle.
