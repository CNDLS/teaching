<p class="lead" id="top">There are too many great books and articles on teaching and learning to list in one place, but below you’ll find a selection of the texts that we’ve found useful.</p>

### Ambrose, S.A., Bridges, M.W., DiPietro, M., Lovett, M.C., Norman, M.K., &amp; Mayer, R.E.. (2010). *How Learning Works*. Jossey-Bass.

An exploration of seven questions that inform the learning process, with answers drawn from the research: How students' prior knowledge affects their learning, how students’ organization of knowledge affect their learning, what factors motivate students to learn, how students develop mastery, what kinds of practice and feedback enhance learning, why student development and course climate matter for student learning, and how students become self-directed learners.

### Bain, Ken. (2004). *What the Best College Teachers Do*. Harvard University Press.

In this book, Ken Bain explains the results of his research of investigating various professors from various departments to figure out what makes a great professor so effective. In 8 chapters he goes over his study, emphasizing the traits of a good professor, such as adaptability (adjusting what and how they teach to respond to the students’ needs as individuals and as a whole), respecting the students (not just having faith in their abilities, but also granting them some autonomy over their coursework), creating an engaging and safe environment in which students can struggle and succeed, and being willing to listen to feedback and criticism.

### Bean, J.C. (2011) *Engaging Ideas: The Professor’s Guide to Integrating Writing, Critical Thinking, and Active Learning in the Classroom*. Jossey-Bass.

This book, which has become something of a classic in the field, covers a range of topics concerning the teaching of writing, reading, and critical thinking—and the relationships between them. Along with particular tools and strategies for teaching, Engaging Ideas discusses assignment design (including both formal, graded assignments, and informal, low-stakes assignments) and methods for assessing student learning.

### Brown, P.C., Roediger, H.L., &amp; McDaniel, M.A. (2014). *Make It Stick*. Belknap.

On the one hand, this book is a debunker of many of the things we believe about learning but that research doesn’t actually support, including everything from the usefulness of immediate and single-minded repetition to a reverence for learning styles. On the other, the volume outlines a set of strategies that do help people learn, including practicing the retrieval of knowledge, particularly when the retrieval is spaced out, varied, and effortful, and more.

### Chasteen, Stephanie. “How Can I Help Students Feel Intrinsically and Extrinsically Motivated to Engage in Active Learning?” PhysPort, American Association of Physics Teachers, 5 July 2017, <a href="https://www.physport.org/recommendations/Entry.cfm?ID">www.physport.org/recommendations/Entry.cfm?ID</a>.

This article goes over the differences between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, highlighting the limitations and advantages of each. Professor Chasteen argues that intrinsic motivations work better, and provides an extensive list of reasons why and suggestions of how to engage and enhance a student’s motivations in class. These suggestions are surprisingly extensive, and are divided into separate sections for ease of focus.

### Condon, W., Iverson, E.R., Manduca, C.A., Rutz, C., &amp; Willett, G. (2016). Connecting Faculty Learning to Student Learning. From *Faculty Development and Student Learning: Assessing the Connections*. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.

This chapter argues that faculty learn to teach one way or another—either through formal opportunities or informally, as a result of experience—and breaks down the different opportunities and moments in the life of a teacher when faculty development can and does happen: (1) formal faculty development in planned events, like workshops and conferences; (2) individual, intentional, self-directed efforts through doing SoTL research or reading up in the literature; and (3) regularly occurring events in the faculty lifecycle, including annual reviews, hiring experiences, and so on, where development may happen more incidentally than intentionally. The authors suggest that faculty development does lead to changes in teaching practice, and make the point that we need to do more work to demonstrate that those changes lead to changes in student learning.

### Curzan, Anne. “When Will We Talk About The Syllabus?” *Pardon Our Interruption*, The Chronicle of Higher Education, 10 Aug. 2017.

Though brief, this article discusses the benefits of going over the syllabus last during the first class session of the semester, instead starting with more active exercises. Linguistics Professor Anne Curzan relates how she opens her sessions with linguistic games and puzzles to show the students the kind of participatory, investigative, and engaging course her class will be. When she finally gets to the syllabus, she can then reference what they discussed/did earlier to emphasize her motives and explain her expectations for the class.

### Davis, Barbara Gross. (2001). *Tools For Teaching*. Jossey-Bass Publishers.

This revised version of Davis’s book traces strategies for faculty across disciplines and particularly targets teachers at different points in their careers: junior, mid-career, and senior faculty. Davis provides resources from the organization of a course to delivering a lecture to end-of-semester evaluations. Although unable to discuss each concept in depth, Tools For Teaching serves as an excellent index for thinking about tools—conceptual and technical—to use in the classroom.

### Doyle, Terry and Zakrajsek, Todd. (2013). *The New Science of Learning: How to Learn in Harmony with Your Brain*. Stylus.

Written for undergraduates, this book is not a study skills book, but rather a concise and accessible introduction to recent research on the brain and how to effectively align one’s habits and lifestyle with the concrete lessons we learn from that research. It’s thick on brain processes and the healthy practices that support learning. Although oriented to students, it’s extremely useful for faculty and others interested in helping students to be self-aware about their practices and how to get the biggest bang for your brain’s buck.

### Ferguson, Roderick A. (2012) *The Reorder of Things: The University and its Pedagogies of Minority Difference*. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.

This book chronicles the development of academic “interdisciplines,” such as gender and ethnicity studies, that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s in response to movements for social justice. Ferguson takes up the question of disciplines designed to deal with difference, and asks how these disciplinary shifts have evolved alongside challenges to contemporary power structures in the academy.

### Gutiérrez, Gabriella, Ed. (2012) *Presumed Incompetent: The Intersections of Race and Class for Women in Academia*. Boulder: University Press of Colorado.

This edited volume brings together personal narratives and empirical research about the experiences of women of color in academia from over 40 authors. The texts explore topics ranging from hiring, promotion and tenure to negotiating relationships with colleagues and building coalitions between and among institutions.

### Hodges, Linda C. (2015) *Teaching Undergraduate Science: A Guide to Overcoming Obstacles to Student Learning*. Stylus.

Each chapter is a standalone, covering a host of obstacles for teaching science in an undergraduate curriculum. Overall, the book stands as a research-based advocacy for the significance and efficiency of active learning in STEM fields. Eminently practical and covering most aspect of college learning processes, it’s an easy way to think through the effectiveness of one’s own teaching and pick up a myriad of research-based techniques for making teaching effective.

### Hooks, bell. (1994). *Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom*.
In this book, bell hooks reflects on her experiences in the classroom, both as a student and later an educator. Her reflections are woven into her theories on pedagogical approaches to the classroom that can provide freeing and engaging experiences for all students in the classroom. Viewing education and theory as “a liberatory practice,” hooks emphasizes the role of education in empowering students to "transgress" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries. Throughout the chapters of this collection, hooks also focuses in on feminist theory, the role of personal experience in the classroom, and her inspiration in Paulo Freire.

Johnson, Brad. (2016). *On Being a Mentor*. New York: Routledge.
This book is a comprehensive reflection on mentorship in academia, covering everything from the robust benefits of mentorship and the many forms it can take to the skills and attributes faculty need to navigate these relationships successfully and the obstacles and challenges that can arise along the way. Later chapters examine particular dynamics—mentoring of undergraduates vs. graduate students vs. junior faculty; mentoring and race; mentoring and gender—as well as the role that departmental and college-level administrators can play in fostering an environment where mentorship can thrive.

### Lang, James M. (2016) *Small Teaching*. Jossey-Bass.

Like the title suggests, this book emphasizes “small teaching” and offers small, practical strategies to facilitate better student learning. Each of the chapters models a different technique and suggests how and when the concept can be implemented in a class—often this occurs over one or two class periods. Lang’s examples range from regaining student attention after a conversation gets derailed to providing an effective wrap-up at the end of class discussion. While the strategies in Small Teaching can be implemented individually (and almost immediately), Lang also helps readers to think more broadly about knowledge, understanding, and inspiration in the classroom.

### Lawrie, G., Marquis, E., Fuller, E., Newman, T., Qui, M., Nomikoudis, M., Roelofs, F., &amp; van Dam, L. (2017). Moving Towards Inclusive Learning and Teaching: A Synthesis of Recent Literature. *Teaching &amp; Learning Inquiry*, 5(1).

In this article, which reviews the literature on inclusive teaching, the authors argue that a truly inclusive learning environment is best created if there are commitments at several levels in an institution; a learning environment becomes inclusive when we incorporate the lived experiences of students, the disciplinary engagements and skills of faculty, the interdisciplinary expertise of academic developers, and the policies and governance created and supported by administrators. They also discuss the need to consider assessment (the ways in which we evaluate students) when we think about inclusivity.

### Lieberman, Mark. “To Flip or Not to Flip?” *As Harvard Professor Reverses Course on Online Lectures, Debate over Flipped Classrooms Remains*, Inside Higher Ed, 13 Sept. 2017.

This article has professors from various universities weigh in on the pros and cons of flipped classrooms. The first two are Professors Yakut Gazi and Stephen Harmon, who take a positive view of the potential for a flipped classroom; they argue that the ability to take the passive elements of teaching, such as lectures, and put them outside class time opens class meetings to more active discussions, presentations, and engagements with the content. Professor Jonathan Rees, however, argues that most notions of a flipped classroom are just putting online aspects of a traditional class without adjusting or consideration to fit the potential of the technology. He is more skeptical than the previous professors, believing that the only reason to flip a classroom (or add some new type of technology to one’s teaching) should be motivated by careful study of the technology and a sincere belief that it will help the students; flipping the classroom just because it seems to be the new thing, to Rees, is detrimental to both students and professors. Lastly, Professor Robert Talbert goes a step further and argues that the central course all the professors are discussing—Professor Malan’s CS50 course at Harvard—wasn’t a flipped course. Instead of altering the traditional teaching method using technology to emphasize the active learning component of education (the part that really challenges students to do their own critical analysis and research), Malan’s class just shifted the traditional model from in-class to online. This is why, to Talbert, Malan’s class failed.

### McGuire, Saundra and McGuire, Stephanie. (2015). *Teach Students How to Learn: Strategies You Can Incorporate Into Any Course to Improve Student Metacognition, Study Skills, and Motivation*. Stylus.

Saundra McGuire, an educator, scholar, and Director Emerita of the Louisiana State University’s Center for Academic Success, writes extensively about the benefits—and the reach of who can benefit—of metacognitive learning strategies. McGuire outlines how introducing students to Bloom’s Taxonomy, growth mindset, and specific study tactics can yield more understanding for all students, including those who arrive on campus underprepared.

### Sacks, Peter. (2007) *Tearing Down the Gates: Confronting the Class Divide in American Education*. Berkeley: University of California Press.

Draws on student narratives and demographic research, this book investigates the relationship between higher education and the structures of class in the United States. Crucially, the book confronts the mythology of upward mobility in American society and argues that higher education must re-think its commitment to equality of opportunity to better engage with the issue of class.

### Smith, Daryl G. (2015). *Diversity’s Promise for Higher Education: Making it Work*. 2nd Edition. Johns Hopkins University Press.

Smith has been at the forefront of fostering diversity in higher education for years. This book, solidly grounded in the scholarship, offers history and context that in and of itself make reading it worthwhile, but is ultimately focused on a wealth of distilled findings concerning how to make a positive impact with regard to marginalized communities in higher education today. Additionally, the book wades directly into the contentious discussion concerning just what diversity is—what we mean by it, what we ought to mean by it, and the thorny challenges that arise with a diversity agenda.

### Steele, Claude M. (2011). *Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do*. NY, NY: Norton.

Steele helped introduce to the world to the “Stereotype Threat”—the now well-documented phenomenon where known social stereotypes related to identity (e.g., race, gender, age) can significantly impact the performance (for both good and ill) of those who feel linked to the identity in question, particularly when that identity is made salient. This book is a wonderfully readable and engaging summation of decades of research on the topic, together with solid advice for how to mitigate stereotype threat’s potential harms and help students to achieve their potential. NOTE: The original article that began this line of research was: Steele, C.M. &amp; Aronson, J. (1995). Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69(5), 797-811.

### Tatum, Beverly Daniel. (2017). *Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?: And Other Conversations About Race*

In this book, Beverly Daniel Tatum, Ph.D., a psychologist and President Emerita of Spelman College, examines racial identity development in the context of Whiteness in the US, aiming to prepare readers to engage in conversations about race. Starting with a framing definition of racism through her “moving walkway of racism” metaphor, Tatum focuses on Black and White identity as well as challenges facing communities of color in a society where Whiteness is seen as “normal” or “neutral.” Tatum’s background includes work on race relations in the classroom, and this text also discusses on racial identity development in adulthood. First published in 1997, the latest edition includes commentary on the role of the Obama presidency in the US conversation about race.

### Wehlburg, Catherine M. (2006). *Meaningful Course Revision: Enhancing Academic Engagement Using Student Learning Data*. Jossey-Bass.

In this book, Wehlburg uses assessment and student learning data as a framework to discuss many key aspects of good teaching and learning practice. From classroom assessment techniques to experiential and problem-based learning activities, her book centers on using data on student learning to make informed course design decisions. A quick and easy read, this is a great introduction to assessment as part of the teaching and learning cycle.

### Wiggins, Grant, and McTighe, Jay. (1998). *Understanding by Design*. ASCD.

Wiggins and McTighe have become well known for their exploration, in this book, of the concept of “backward design.” This pedagogical approach asks us to think about what goals we have for student learning and to work backward from there to figure out what sorts of pedagogical choices we need to make—what we teach, what we assign, what and how we grade—in order to help students reach those goals. In Understanding by Design, as the title suggests, the authors argue for the importance of making understanding (in all its complexity) one of your central goals, and they delve into the different ways you can pursue understanding.
