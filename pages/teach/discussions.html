title: Difficult Discussions
order: 2.9

<p class="lead">As the news regularly reminds us, local and national events find their way into the classroom, and difficult discussions are an inescapable part of higher education; they even crop up in courses whose focus is theoretically far removed from topics of public controversy. The diversity of our students, their experiences, and our collective interests create conditions where conflict and volatile conversations are always possible. Often it’s the role of faculty to lead students in exploring “hot button” items that can arouse intense opinions and feelings.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it’s important to consider techniques for designing a classroom where this engagement can take place constructively. Below are a list of helpful resources for faculty who actively seek to engage students on current hot topics, as well as those simply looking to be more prepared when these topics arise.</p>

The AAC&U is the leading national association of undergraduate institutions of higher education focused on liberal education. Their statement attempts to identify what academic freedom is, articulate its value, and delineate what it means to responsibly engage diversity in our institutions of higher education, all in the service of facilitating the kind of learning that will allow students to positively contribute to society.

Additionally, as a university community, we’re interested in drawing on the collective experience and skills of those who have been involved with students in heated or controversial discussions. If you have additional resources, experiences, techniques, or anecdotes that we could share here, please consider submitting them.
