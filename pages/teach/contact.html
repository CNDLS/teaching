<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Office hours may be spent providing individual or small-group tutoring to students requiring extra help, holding oral presentations or exams, or returning student work and explaining the assigned grade and areas for improvement.</p>

<p>When planning your office hours, the first important consideration is scheduling: as far as possible, you should make sure that your office hours are at times when students can attend. For example, if your course has co-requisite courses or your program has mandatory activities, do not schedule your office hours in conflict with them. The second point to consider is location: make sure that students know where your office is located. Some faculty members hold a portion of their office hours at locations that are convenient for the students: a student lounge; a group study area in the library; a common area in the residence hall; or a popular coffee shop or eatery on campus. Students may be more likely to use your services if you go to them, and holding some office hours in public places may also put students more at ease. You can also schedule some virtual office hours.</p>

<p>If students come to your office hours to contest a grade, it is a good idea to ask them prepare a written justification of why they believe the grade you have assigned them should be changed. In this document, they will need to make specific reference to course materials and aspects of their own work that they feel justify a different grade. You could even prepare a template for students to use when requesting a re-grade, which will help them organize their thoughts.</p>


<h2>Email and Other Contact</h2>

<p>Whatever method you select, you need to establish ground rules for communication. Indicate which types of situations require which type of communication. Let students know what topics are appropriate for messages and what they can expect as a response. For example, if they email you regarding difficulties with a homework problem, will you reply with the answer to the problem, will you reply with hints or strategies to help them solve the problem on their own, or will you reply asking them to make an appointment to see you in person? You should also let them know how you would like to be addressed in your messages and ask them to indicate how they would like to be addressed. Students from different backgrounds may have different customs regarding how to address teachers.</p>

<p>Asynchronous methods of communication such as email allow the writer time to fine-tune his or her message, which may be a great advantage for people who feel uncomfortable responding on the spot, or for non-native speakers, who may require a little more time to formulate their statements. For these reasons, email may be the ideal way to communicate with your students outside of class. </p>

<p>You must also indicate to students when you will check and respond to messages. Be sure to let them know the expected turnaround time. If you are going to be away or otherwise unable to respond to messages during the agreed-on window, advise students in advance, if possible.</p>

<p>Some professors find it useful to ask students to state in the subject line of the message both their course code and an indication of the type of question they have. This makes it easier to sort incoming messages and prioritize replies.</p>

<p>Mobile devices allow you to stay connected virtually anywhere, at any time. However, this also has its drawbacks: it can be very time-consuming to compose long or complicated messages and it can also be very difficult to convey tone, thus leading to more potential misinterpretations. Additionally, sending email messages from a mobile device may limit you in length or ability to attach documents.</p>

<p>Other communication methods, such as telephone or face-to-face communication, have advantages that e-mail does not. Depending on the nature of the student’s question, it may be wiser to deal with it using one of these other methods. You may even choose to write a letter to a student in particular situations requiring more official communication.</p>
