title: Communication and Contact
order: 2.3

The schedule for regular office hours should be published on the course syllabus. Ideally, these should fall on different days/times throughout the week to avoid conflicts with other class meetings, and you may also want to offer hours by appointment. Be sure to specify the preferred mode of contact for yourself and your teaching assistants - i.e. don’t list a shared office extension if you don’t expect to receive messages there. (Note that you can <a href="http://thecorp.org/services/midnight-mug/">hold office hours at the Midnight Mug</a> coffee shop in Lauinger Library.) You may also want to clarify how promptly you will typically respond to messages and what types of questions about assignments are appropriate to send by email.

## Instructional Continuity

Per the <a href="https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/y01o84wupuzmna3ib50p">instructional continuity policy</a> instituted in July 2014, instructional activities will be maintained during campus closures. This means that you should establish a plan for continuing academic work when students are unable to attend face-to-face classes, and this plan should be clearly communicated to students before disruptions occur. However, you should also keep in mind that power outages or other issues may cause communication difficulties for particular students or for faculty, and be prepared for how to address such issues. The <a href="http://instructionalcontinuity.georgetown.edu/">Instructional Continuity site</a>, created during the impressive snowstorms of 2010, offers some strategies for coping with disruptions and some examples of how faculty have addressed these challenges.
