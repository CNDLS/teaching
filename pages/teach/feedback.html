title: Gathering Feedback
order: 2.8

<p class=lead>You can get some feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching using Classroom Assessment Techniques, which give you an immediate report of what students are understanding.</p>

<p>As we discuss in the Assessments section of this handbook, CATs are short in-class activities like the One-Minute Paper, in which students spend a minute writing a short answer to a prompt of your choice related to the day’s lesson. Other ways to gather feedback on your teaching include mid-semester group feedback sessions (MSGFs) or pairing up with a trusted colleague to sit in on one another's classes.</p>

<p>If you cannot devote class time to an MSGF, you can also compose your own feedback mechanism to collect feedback outside of class. Some faculty members have had success with online surveys posing open-ended questions such as, “What am I doing that facilitates your learning?”, “What is not working for you in this class?”, “What concrete actions can I take to make the class a more effective learning experience for you?”. Questions like these require students to think about their own learning and assure them that you take their needs into account when designing your teaching. Once you have gathered students’ feedback, it is recommended that you report back to them, addressing what they have said and letting them know which suggested changes you can implement immediately, which you will consider for future editions of the course, and which are unfeasible due to various factors.</p>

<p>Rather than make students wait until mid-semester to give feedback, some faculty members use ongoing strategies such as a suggestion box or the selection of a class representative to whom students can go to voice their concerns and who can be counted on to share the concerns with the professor anonymously and in a timely fashion.</p>
