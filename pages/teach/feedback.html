title: Gathering Feedback
order: 2.8

<p class=lead>Experienced teachers know that “How do I want class to go?” and “How is class actually going?” are two different questions, and both are worth asking.</p>

As we discuss in the <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='design/assessment') }}">Assessments section</a> of this guide, there are a number of both high-stakes and low-stakes ways to find out what exactly students are learning. <a href="http://assessment.georgetown.edu/courselevel/gather-evidence-of-student-learning/classroom-assessment-techniques/">CATs (Classroom Assessment Techniques)</a> are short in-class activities like the One-Minute Paper, in which students spend a minute writing a short answer to a prompt of your choice related to the day’s lesson. These should give you a good sense of what students understand and, indirectly, how effectively you’re teaching.

There are also ways to gather feedback more directly on your teaching, including <a href="https://cndls.georgetown.edu/support/assessment/msgf/">mid-semester group feedback sessions (MSGFs)</a> or pairing up with a trusted colleague to sit in on one another's classes.

If you can’t devote class time to an <a href="https://cndls.georgetown.edu/support/assessment/msgf/">MSGF</a>, you can also **compose your own mechanism** to collect feedback, with students completing them either quickly in class or at their leisure outside class. Mid-semester can be a good time to do this; by that time, the course has been running long enough for students to have informed opinions, and there’s still enough time to implement some changes. Some faculty members have had success with surveys, in-person and online, posing open-ended questions such as:

* “What am I doing that facilitates your learning?”
* “What is not working for you in this class?”
* “What concrete actions can I take to make the class a more effective learning experience for you?”

Questions like these require students to think about their own learning and assure them that you take their needs into account when designing your teaching. 

Of course, you don’t have to wait until mid-semester to gather feedback; some faculty members use **ongoing strategies** such as a suggestion box or the selection of a class representative to whom students can go to voice their concerns and who can be counted on to share the concerns with the professor anonymously and in a timely fashion.

Once you have gathered students’ feedback, it’s a good idea to **report back to them**, addressing what they’ve said and letting them know which suggested changes you can implement immediately, which you’ll consider for future editions of the course, and which are unfeasible for various reasons. Showing them that you take their views seriously should encourage them to continue providing helpful feedback.
