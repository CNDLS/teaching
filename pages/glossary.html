title: Glossary

<h2>Active learning</h2>
<p>Although information is important, passively accumulating disconnected information is not learning. To learn, students have to be mentally and often physically active as they discover their own answers, solutions, concepts, and relationships and create their own interpretations; this learning is deeper, more comprehensive, and longer lasting, and the learning that occurs actively leads to an ability to think critically. </p>


<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>"Assessment: A productive way to monitor student understanding and instructional effectiveness is formative assessment. Perhaps the best known examples of classroom formative feedback fall into the category of CATs (Classroom Assessment Techniques). CATs are generally simple, non-graded, anonymous, in-class activities designed to give you and your students useful feedback on the teaching-learning process as it is happening. This broad umbrella includes use of students response systems or clickers, simple quizzes, muddiest point (where at the end of an instructional moment students are asked to indicate in some way what was the most confusing aspect for them), and the one-minute paper (a summary written in one minute). Low-stakes assignments give students the opportunity to practice skills without the stress of high-stakes assignments and can also serve as formative assessment.</p>

<p>Summative assessment is an end-point evaluation of student learning. High-stakes grading refers to the use of assignments, such as major essays, term papers, and group projects, that carry significant assessment weight to evaluate the learning of a student.</p>

<p>In addition to assessing student learning, you can assess the effectiveness of your teaching. A complex activity like teaching is understood best when it is viewed from more than one perspective: instructor self-assessment, student perceptions, teaching and learning research, administrative perspective, peer or colleague review, and student learning. Each source offers valuable information, but none by itself gives the whole picture."</p>


<h2>Backward design</h2>
<p>The design process starts at the end, the desired results or learning outcomes, and then derives the curriculum from the evidence of learning called for by the standard and the teaching needed to equip students to perform. </p>


<h2>Bottlenecks and Thresholds</h2>
<p>The Bottlenecks and Thresholds Initiative (BTI) helps faculty improve students' disciplinary thinking and engagement through writing, uncovering how instructors can better help their students overcome bottlenecks in their disciplines.</p>


<h2>Case-study method</h2>
<p>“An empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of evidence are used” (23).</p>


<h2>Cognitive apprenticeship</h2>
<p>Effective teachers “involve” students in learning as apprentices: they work alongside students and/or set up situations that will cause students to begin to work on problems even before fully understanding them. A key aspect of an “apprenticeship” approach to teaching involves breaking the problem into parts so that students are challenged to master as much of a task as they are ready to handle. Students develop cognitive and metacognitive strategies for discovering knowledge.</p>


<h2>Community of practice</h2>
<p>Coined by social anthropologist Jean Lave and education researcher Etienne Wenger in their analysis of apprenticeship practices, communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.</p>


<h2>Community-based learning</h2>
<p>Community-based learning (CBL) enriches coursework by encouraging students to apply the knowledge and analytic tools gained in the classroom to the pressing issues that affect local communities.</p>


<h2>Contemplative reading practice</h2>
<p>Contemplative reading occurs when a reader absorbs a text more fully than if he or she were simply reading the text to gain knowledge about of the information presented. Contemplative reading involves reading to gather a deeper understanding of what, how, and why the text presents the information it does.</p>


<h2>Course evaluation</h2>
<p>A course evaluation is a paper or electronic questionnaire, which requires a written or selected response to a series of questions to evaluate the instruction of a given course. It is a common means to produce useful feedback which the teacher and school can use to improve their quality of instruction.</p>


<h2>Course redesign</h2>
<p>Course redesign involves redesigning a course so that it has demonstrable and measurable goals that align with teaching strategies and assessment mechanisms. It is recommended that you select strategies that encourage active learning and monitor student progress so that you can provide support to students who require it.</p>


<h2>Cura personalis</h2>
<p>The Jesuit principle of cura personalis, which means “care of the person,” the phrase cura personalis was used to describe the responsibility of the Jesuit Superior to encourage the fullest possible development of all of the talents of each community member.</p>


<h2>Deep learning</h2>
<p>As compared to Surface, Deep learning is an approach to study that focuses on what is signified, relates previous knowledge to new knowledge, relates knowledge from different courses, relates theoretical ideas to everyday experience, relates and distinguishes evidence and argument, organizes and structures content into a coherent whole, and has an internal emphasis from within the student.  </p>


<h2>Digital humanities</h2>
<p>The digital humanities is an area of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It incorporates both digitized and born-digital materials and combines the methodologies from the traditional arts and humanities disciplines with tools provided by computing and digital publishing fields.</p>


<h2>Disciplinary languages</h2>
<p>"Disciplinary languages refer to the body of terms used regularly in scholarly work in the discipline, without which a student will be challenged in reading disciplinary work.  In English, for example, ""discourse,"" ""apparatus,"" and ""domain"" become foundational terms for discussing literary works in the context of cultural theory.</p>

<p>Concepts signified by the terms that compose a disciplinary language may be student learning ""bottlenecks"" that are conceptually difficult for students.  For more information on bottlenecks, see the Bottlenecks and Thresholds Project here at Georgetown, look up disciplinary thinking, or find out more about David Pace's and Joan Middendorf's pioneering work on the topic. "</p>


<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>"Diversity refers to variety in terms of race, gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, and religion. Diversity can also indicate the range of differences in traits such as political beliefs, class year, learning styles, and interests.</p>

<p>Inclusive teaching: In today’s college environment both faculties and students come from a wide variety of backgrounds; this diversity can often create a richer learning environment, but to truly tap into the potential, the teaching must take into account diversity and be able to include and engage the different voices and experience of student and instructor alike."</p>


<h2>Doyle Program</h2>
<p>The Doyle Program [http://doyle.georgetown.edu/] serves the entire Georgetown University community and is a campus-wide collaboration between the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS) and Georgetown College designed to deepen the university's own commitment to tolerance and diversity and enhance global awareness of the challenges and opportunities of an era of increasing interconnectedness.</p>


<h2>Engaging intellect and affect</h2>
<p>"Engaging intellect and affect means finding ways to bring academic and cognitive aspects of a topic into conversation with the more social and personal aspects. Engaging the affective domain requires tapping into issues such as personal attitudes, feelings, emotions, motivation, and values.  This is closely related to the Georgetown core value of Engaging the Whole Person.</p>

<p>Theory suggests that deeper and more meaningful learning occurs when teachers engage both the cognitive and the affective pieces in the design of a course, activity, lecture or discussion."</p>


<h2>Engelhard Project</h2>
<p>Using a curriculum infusion approach, the Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning focuses on teaching to the whole student by bringing health and wellness issues into the classroom in a way that supports student knowledge gain and encourages students to reflect on their own attitudes and behaviors.</p>


<h2>Expertise</h2>
<p>"Unlike novices, experts notice features and meaningful patterns of information and have acquired a great deal of content knowledge that is organized in ways that reflect a deep understanding of their subject matter.</p>
<p>Experts’ knowledge cannot be reduced to sets of isolated facts or propositions but, instead, reflects contexts of applicability. Experts are able to flexibly retrieve important aspects of their knowledge with little attentional effort.
Adaptive Expertise: Adaptive expertise, a term coined by Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki, describes a certain fluency and flexibility with a subject that allows individuals to creatively apply tools, skills, and methods to solve novel problems. "</p>


<h2>Flipped classroom </h2>
<p>Flipping the classroom makes the most of class time by moving delivery of course content to outside class time (taking advantage of technological innovations such as lecture capture software to do so) and using class time for application exercises, which traditionally would have been completed as homework. This means that for the more cognitively challenging tasks that ask students to apply the material, the students can interact with each other and receive support from the professor in real time.</p>


<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>"Receiving Student Feedback:
The feedback students provide about your teaching on their end-of-semester course evaluations can be valuable in helping you improve and refine your teaching.</p>  

<p>Giving students feedback: Feedback provides students with the opportunity to revise and gather responses to their work, at all stages of the process, from conception to final product. Instructors need to consider ahead of time how they will respond to student work, including written, oral, and multimedia projects.</p>

<p>Mid-semester feedback methods help faculty to gather feedback from students at the midpoint of the semester and to develop possible responses to students' comments. "</p>


<h2>Higher-order thinking</h2>
<p>"Higher order thinking skills include critical, logical, reflective, metacognitive, and creative thinking. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas.</p> 

<p>Benjamin Bloom (later updated by Anderson and Krathwohl) developed a taxonomy of the cognitive domain that illustrates the relationships between lower order and higher order skills.</p>

<h2>Instructional continuity</h2>
<p>Instructional continuity refers to the goal of continuing course work despite disruptions due to weather, illness, or other factors.  Visit <a href=http://instructionalcontinuity.georgetown.edu/>Instructional Continuity</a> to see how Georgetown faculty and students maintain meetings and classes.  </p>


<h2>Inquiry-based approach</h2>
<p>Inquiry-based instruction is a student-centered and teacher-guided instructional approach that engages students in investigating real world questions that they choose within a broad thematic framework.</p>


<h2>Just-in-time teaching</h2>
<p>Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT for short) is a teaching and learning strategy based on the interaction between web-based study assignments and an active learner classroom. Students respond electronically to carefully constructed web-based assignments which are due shortly before class, and the instructor reads the student submissions "just-in-time" to adjust the classroom lesson to suit the students' needs. Thus, the heart of JiTT is the "feedback loop" formed by the students' outside-of-class preparation that fundamentally affects what happens during the subsequent in-class time together. </p>


<h2>Knowledge transfer</h2>
<p>Knowledge Transfer in the fields of organizational development and organizational learning is the practical problem of transferring knowledge from one part of the organization to another (or all other) part(s) of the organization in an effort to organize, create, capture or distribute knowledge and ensure its availability for future users.</p>


<h2>Learner characteristics</h2>
<p>"There are five dimensions of learning style: perception (sensory or intuitive); input modality (visual-nonverbal, visual-verbal, auditory, or tactile-kinesthetic); organization (inductive or deductive); processing (active or reflective); and understanding (sequential or global)."</p>


<h2>Learning community</h2>
<p>Learning communities are classes or groups linked or clustered often around an interdisciplinary theme, and enroll a common cohort of participants.</p>


<h2>Learning space</h2>
<p>Classroom design: The design of any learning space is a collaborative effort between architects, university officials, faculty, and students. Primary consideration should be for the needs of the users (both immediately and for long-term purposes of the space), and designs should be flexible. Learning spaces are typically with the physical boundaries of a classroom, studio, or lab, but may arise in all different kinds of spaces, from physical to virtual to communal.</p>                                                                                                                            

<p>Activity design:<br />
Will the activity lead to the desired learning?<br />
Will I be able to tell?<br />
Does the pedagogy promote learning?<br />
Does the activity motivate and engage students?<br />
Does it build on what they know and address their initial beliefs?<br />
Is it appropriate for the variety of students expected in the class?<br />
Are students engaged in independent thinking and problem solving?<br />
Are there opportunities for students to iterate and improve their understanding incrementally?<br />
Is there an appropriate balance of guidance vs exploration?<br />
Does it include opportunities for reflection, discussion, and synthesis?<br />
Does it provide opportunities for students to assess their learning and confirm they are on the right track?<br />
Are the materials I provide for students complete and helpful?<br />
Could someone else implement this from the information I provide?</p>


<h2>Learning through practice</h2>
<p>Practice-based learning is education that comes from experiencing real work in real situations. It can assist the initial preparation for and further development of skills for a wider range of occupations, and it is an important facet of professional development and life-long learning.</p>


<h2>lifelong learning</h2>
<p>Life-long learning refers to the concept of building skills and knowledge throughout the life of an individual. Educational experiences do not have to be traditional educational experiences, but can be through informal means as well.</p>


<h2>Metacognition</h2>
<p>Metacognition is thinking about thinking.</p>


<h2>MOOC</h2>
<p>A MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) is a model of educational delivery that is, to varying degrees, massive, with theoretically no limit to enrollment; open, allowing anyone to participate, usually at no cost; online, with learning activities typically taking place over the web; and a course, structured around a set of learning goals in a defined area of study. The range of MOOCs embody these principles in different ways, and the particulars of how MOOCs function continue to evolve.</p>


<h2>OLI</h2>
<p>The Open Learning Initiative (OLI) is a grant-funded group at Carnegie Mellon University, offering innovative online courses to anyone who wants to learn or teach. The aim is to create high-quality courses and contribute original research to improve learning and transform higher education.</p>


<h2>Participatory culture</h2>
<p>A participatory culture is a culture with relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, and some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices.</p>


<h2>POGIL</h2>
<p>Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning is a classroom and laboratory technique that seeks to simultaneously teach content and key process skills such as the ability to think analytically and work effectively as part of a collaborative team.</p>


<h2>Problem of learning</h2>
<p>In scholarship and research, having a "problem" is at the heart of the investigative process. But in one’s teaching, a "problem" is something you don’t want to have, and if you have one, you probably want to fix it. Asking a colleague about a problem in his or her research is an invitation; asking about a problem in one’s teaching would probably seem like an accusation. Changing the status of the problem in teaching from terminal remediation to ongoing investigation is precisely what the movement for a scholarship of teaching is all about. How might we make the problematization of teaching a matter of regular communal discourse? How might we think of teaching practice, and the evidence of student learning, as problems to be investigated, analyzed, represented, and debated?</p>


<h2>Problem-based learning</h2>
<p>Through problem-based learning, students learn how to use an iterative process of assessing what they know, identifying what they need to know, gathering information, and collaborating on the evaluation of hypotheses in light of the data they have collected. </p>


<h2>Problem-solving activities</h2>
<p>Problem solving is a process in which we perceive and resolve a gap between a present situation and a desired goal, with the path to the goal blocked by known or unknown obstacles.</p>


<h2>Public scholarship</h2>
<p>Public scholarship is complex knowledge that is part of broader trends and movements for change. Publicly engaged academic work is scholarly or creative activity integral to a faculty member’s academic area. It encompasses different forms of making knowledge “about, for, and with” diverse publics and communities. Through a coherent, purposeful sequence of activities, it contributes to the public good and yields artifacts of public and intellectual value.</p>


<h2>Rubrics</h2>
<p>A rubric is an assessment matrix based on a set of criteria (self or group defined) used to evaluate a student’s performance across a holistic spectrum.</p>


<h2>Scaffolding</h2>
<p>The term ‘scaffolding’ was developed as a metaphor to describe the type of assistance offered by a teacher or peer to support learning. In the process of scaffolding, the teacher helps the student master a task or concept that the student is initially unable to grasp independently. </p>


<h2>Social networking</h2>
<p>We define social network sites as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site.</p>


<h2>SoTL</h2>
<p>"The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning is a practice in which faculty members apply the same approaches that they use in their research to their teaching and their conceptualization of learning.  SoTL practitioner Pat Hutchings, working with the Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, has identified four different kinds of questions SoTL projects might ask and answer:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>"Is it working?" – evaluating whether the learning strategies are helping the students achieve the desired learning goals</li>

		<li>"What does it look like?" – developing a descriptive framework for thinking 	about teaching and learning</li>

		<li>"What would it look like?" – envisioning approaches that are new for the 						field</li>

		<li>"How can we conceptualize or theorize about what is happening?" – building a 	different way of making meaning of what teachers and students do</li>
	</ol>
</p>


<h2>Student learning goals</h2>
<p>"Learning goals can be written for individual courses or for academic programs. They answer two questions:</p>
<p>What do you want students to know by the time they finish a course or a major?<br />
What do you want students to be able to do with what they know?<br /></p>
<p>Aligning goals refers to setting up content standards, performance standards, curriculum, instruction, and assessments to all work toward meeting particular knowledge and skill expectations."</p>


<h2>Student perspectives</h2>
<p>Student perspectives refers to the range of range of worldviews that students bring to the classroom. Student perspectives can create an enriching mood of diversity and exploration when solicited in an environment that enforces respect and curiosity.</p>


<h2>Student-centered learning</h2>
<p>Actively preparing lectures and activities to fit the needs of the student, not the needs of the teacher.</p>


<h2>Students as experts</h2>
<p>As newcomers to their respective fields, students are typically novice in their understanding of the subject matter. But students can begin to develop expertise by engaging in the practice of experts—learning not just content, but also how to think like an expert thinks.</p>


<h2>Synthesizing information</h2>
<p>Drawing upon elements from different learning experiences to make sense of a problem or deepen their understanding. See <a href=http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/>Vanderbilt's guide on Bloom's Taxonomy</a>.</p>


<h2>Tacit knowledge</h2>
<p>"Tacit knowledge is knowledge that has become ingrained, operational, and does not draw attention to itself. A person who possesses tacit knowledge in a domain will probably not know what they know (what they once had to learn). "</p>


<h2>Think-aloud</h2>
<p>A strategy for uncovering someone's thought process involving describing and recording each step in solving problems through recording or computer technology.</p>


<h2>Think-pair-share</h2>
<p>Used to engage students in prior knowledge of a topic. Students first think about a question related to the topic of study, then pair up with a partner to share throughts, and finally the pairs choose one major idea to share with the entire class.</p>


<h2>Tracking progress</h2>
<p>Refers to the process of evaluating students' development toward the learning goals that they has set through informal classroom assessment techniques or formal traditional assignments such as quizzes and essays.</p>


<h2>Transparent grading</h2>
<p>The process of helping students understand the grade they have received through rubrics, comments, distribution of points, or location of error.</p>


<h2>Uncoverage</h2>
<p>“Uncoverage” refers to the process by which a few difficult or crucial key terms or concepts in a course are uncovered for students.</p>


<h2>Writing as reflection</h2>
<p>Writing from a first-person perspective in a way that encourages students to think about what they have learned from a particular reading, project, or experience, with an emphasis on helping students become metacognitive of their learning process.</p>


<h2>Writing for an audience</h2>
<p>Writing for an audience refers to the process by which authors of any written object tailor their choice of words, formality, mood, and depth of explanation to their assumed audience. For students, this process is a necessary challenge as they encounter and evaluate new audiences and become more self-reflective about their writing.</p>


<h2>Writing process</h2>
<p>Writing is a process that involves at least four distinct steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, and editing.
