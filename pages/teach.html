<h2>Backward Design</h2>
<p>This section describes a course design method called backward design, which begins with determining the learning goals–the knowledge, skills and attitudes that you wish students to be able to demonstrate by the end of the course–and works backward from there. Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe develop this model in detail in their book Understanding By Design. While most of the examples in that book come from K-12 education, their method can be adapted to university education. L. Dee Fink develops a similar method in his book Creating Significant Learning Experiences:  An Integrated Approach to Designing College Courses and in a <u>short handbook</u> that many faculty members find useful during the design process.<p>

<p>The basic version of backward design has three main elements, but they are not necessarily sequential phases, since the course and syllabus design process is likely to be iterative, as work on one element leads one to revise one’s thinking about other elements.<p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>State clearly and succinctly the knowledge, skills and attitudes you expect your students to demonstrate by the end of the course.</li>
	<li>Identify what you will count as evidence that students have met those goals.  Design tasks and assignments whereby students both practice and demonstrate the desired knowledge, skills and attitudes. Consider a broad range of possible tasks and ways for students to demonstrate their learning and build in feedback mechanisms so students can improve.</li>
	<li>Select the teaching strategies that will best equip your students to succeed on their assignments and achieve the course’s learning goals. Again, consider a broad range of strategies.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order for your course to be properly integrated, it is essential that these three basic elements are aligned. It is important to be asking students to achieve learning goals for which your teaching strategies prepare them, and the assignments do not ask them to demonstrate, and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Active Learning</h2>

<p>Active learning is an approach to education that does not consider students the passive recipients of knowledge transmitted from an expert, but rather, active agents in their own learning.</p>

<p>In active learning, formats such as traditional lectures, where students simply sit and listen while the teacher presents material, are combined with other formats where students actively engage with the material, through talking, writing, reading and reflecting.  It is easy to incorporate active learning techniques into a lecture:  between sections, pose questions or problems, or assign short activities where students work individually or in groups to apply the information you have just presented.  If you are willing to incorporate active learning to a greater degree, consider teaching using case studies, real-world simulations, or student-directed modules (where you are available as a resource, but you do not teach directly).</p>

<p>Studies, such as <u>Freeman et al.’s meta-analysis of undergraduate STEM education</u>, show that student learning improves when their professors incorporate active learning strategies.</p>
