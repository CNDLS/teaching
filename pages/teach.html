title: Active Learning
order: 2.0

<p class="lead">Active learning is an approach to education that does not consider students the passive recipients of knowledge transmitted from an expert, but rather, active agents in their own learning.</p>

In active learning, formats such as traditional lectures, where students simply sit and listen while the teacher presents material, are combined with other formats where students actively engage with the material, through talking, writing, reading and reflecting. Studies, such as Freeman _et al._’s <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full ">meta-analysis of undergraduate STEM education</a>, show that student learning improves when their professors incorporate active learning strategies.

* Incorporating active learning techniques can readily be integrated into a lecture: between sections, pose questions or problems, or assign short activities where students work individually or in groups to apply the information you have just presented.
* It’s also possible to incorporate active learning to a greater degree, devoting significant class time to activities that are not lectures: group discussions, led by you and/or by the students; in-class student presentation and/or analysis of case studies; real-world simulations; or student-directed modules (where you are available as a resource, but you do not teach directly).

## Problem-Based Learning

One particularly rich example of an active learning strategy is Problem-Based Learning. With this strategy, students are given a complex problem, usually resembling something they’d encounter in the real world in the field, and are asked to solve it. They might work in groups, with a mixture of supervision by you and independent work, and would necessarily have to employ a range of skills relevant to the course and the field of study.
 
For example, students might be: presented with a specific but complicated social problem and be asked to think of policy solutions, weighing political forces, economic considerations, research findings, and more, along the way; presented with studies that produce conflicting results (or studies that seem conflict with some real-world happening) and be asked to try to make sense of the conflict, perhaps by reanalysis of the data and the circumstances under which the research was conducted and/or design of a third study; presented with a simulated commission to design a building intended for a particular function or to create an art installation that will work in an unusual space.
 
The scale of these problems can vary; some might be designed to require part or all of a single class session, whereas others might be designed to require weeks of effort or, perhaps, the entire semester. However long it takes, the goal is to help students internalize and integrate what they’ve learned, apply their knowledge and skills flexibly under somewhat realistic conditions, think creatively, work cooperatively, and understand the real-world implications of what they’re studying.
