title: Active Learning
order: 2.0

<p class="lead">Active learning is an approach to education that does not consider students the passive recipients of knowledge transmitted from an expert, but rather, active agents in their own learning.</p>

In active learning, formats such as traditional lectures, where students simply sit and listen while the teacher presents material, are combined with other formats where students actively engage with the material, through talking, writing, reading and reflecting. Studies, such as Freeman _et al._’s <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full ">meta-analysis of undergraduate STEM education</a>, show that student learning improves when their professors incorporate active learning strategies.

* Incorporating active learning techniques can readily be integrated into a lecture: between sections, pose questions or problems, or assign short activities where students work individually or in groups to apply the information you have just presented.
* It’s also possible to incorporate active learning to a greater degree, devoting significant class time to activities that are not lectures: group discussions, led by you and/or by the students; in-class student presentation and/or analysis of case studies; real-world simulations; or student-directed modules (where you are available as a resource, but you do not teach directly).
